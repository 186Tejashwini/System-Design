# Day 2 🗓️  
Started with the concept of **OOPS** (Object-Oriented Programming System) 💻✨

### History of Programming 🕰️

- Initially, **Machine Language** was used. It consists of binary code (`0`s and `1`s) that the computer understands directly.  
  ⚠️ However, writing programs in machine language is **very error-prone**, **difficult**, and **not scalable**.

- Next came **Assembly Language** 🛠️, which uses mnemonic codes like:  
  `MOV A, 61H`  
  to represent machine instructions.  
  Assembly is easier than machine code but still **low-level**, tedious, and error-prone because it works directly with hardware registers and memory.

- Then, **Procedural Programming Languages** (like C, FORTRAN) were developed. These introduced:  
  - **Functions**  
  - **Loops**  
  - **Control structures**  
  helping programmers write more organized and reusable code.  
  ⚠️ But procedural programming struggles with managing large and complex software systems.

- To overcome these limitations, **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** was introduced.  
  OOP models programs as collections of **objects** that represent real-world entities. It promotes:  
  - 🛡️ **Data encapsulation and security**  
  - 📈 **Scalability**  
  - 🔁 **Code reuse**  
  through concepts like **classes**, **inheritance**, and **polymorphism**.
